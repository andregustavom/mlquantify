Description: Quantification is a prominent machine learning task that has received an 
    increasing amount of attention in the last years. The objective is to predict the 
    class distribution of a data sample. This package is a collection of machine learning 
    algorithms for class distribution estimation. This package include algorithms from
    different paradigms of quantification.
